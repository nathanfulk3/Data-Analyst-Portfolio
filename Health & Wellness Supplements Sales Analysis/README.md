# 1️⃣ Business Problem & Hypotheses

## Problem Statement
Optimize sales and revenue for supplement products by understanding demand trends, pricing sensitivity, promotion effectiveness, and return patterns across platforms and regions.

## Hypotheses to Test
- **Higher discounts** lead to higher units sold but may lower revenue per unit.
- **Certain product categories** perform better on specific platforms (e.g., Amazon vs. iHerb).
- **Returns** negatively impact overall revenue disproportionately for some product categories.
- **Sales patterns** are seasonal or trending over time, and forecasting can optimize inventory planning.
